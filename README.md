*Indirection or Dereferencing Operator (*)

The indirection operator (or dereferencing operator) (*) operates on a pointer, and returns the value stored in the address kept in the pointer variable. For example, if pNumber is an int pointer, *pNumber returns the int value "pointed to" by pNumber.

* operator &

The meaning of symbol & is different in an expression and in a declaration. When it is used in an expression, & denotes the address-of operator, which returns the address of a variable, e.g., if number is an int variable, &number returns the address of the variable number (this has been described in the above section).

Howeve, when & is used in a declaration (including function formal parameters), it is part of the type identifier and is used to declare a reference variable (or reference or alias or alternate name). It is used to provide another name, or another reference, or alias to an existing variable.

-----For example:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/* Test reference declaration and initialization (TestReferenceDeclaration.cpp) */

                    //#include <iostream>
  
                    //using namespace std;
  
 
                    //int main() {
  
                   //int number = 88;           Declare an int variable called number
  
                   //int & refNumber = number;  Declare a reference (alias) to the variable number
  
                   // Both refNumber and number refer to the same value
 
                  //cout << number << endl;     Print value of variable number (88)
  
                 //cout << refNumber << endl;  Print value of reference (88)
 
                 //refNumber = 99;             Re-assign a new value to refNumber
  
                 //cout << refNumber << endl;
  
                //cout << number << endl;    // Value of number also changes (99)
  
 
                //number = 55;               // Re-assign a new value to number
  
                 //cout << number << endl;
  
                  //cout << refNumber << endl; // Value of refNumber also changes (55)
  
                   }
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
---For example,
--------------------------------------------------------------------
int number = 88;

int * pNumber = &number;  // Declare and assign the address of variable number to pointer pNumber (0x22ccec)

cout << pNumber<< endl;   // Print the content of the pointer variable, which contain an address (0x22ccec)

cout << *pNumber << endl; // Print the value "pointed to" by the pointer, which is an int (88)

*pNumber = 99;            // Assign a value to where the pointer is pointed to, NOT to the pointer variable

cout << *pNumber << endl; // Print the new value "pointed to" by the pointer (99)

cout << number << endl;   // The value of variable number changes as well (99)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*The difference between reference and pointers:
------------------------------

Pointers: A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. A pointer needs to be dereferenced with the * operator to access the memory location it points to. 

References: A reference variable is an alias, that is, another name for an already existing variable. A reference, like a pointer, is also implemented by storing the address of an object. 
A reference can be thought of as a constant pointer (not to be confused with a pointer to a constant value!) with automatic indirection, i.e., the compiler will apply the * operator for you. 


&& Memory Address: A pointer has its own memory address and size on the stack, whereas a reference shares the same memory address with the original variable but also takes up some space on the stack.
